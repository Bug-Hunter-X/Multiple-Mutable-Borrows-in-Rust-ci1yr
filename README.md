This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust: attempting to create multiple mutable borrows of the same variable.  The `bug.rs` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.rs` provides a corrected version.  The error arises because Rust's ownership and borrowing system prevents data races and ensures memory safety.  Understanding borrowing rules is crucial for writing correct and efficient Rust code.
